# AutoParcel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-parcel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-parcel)

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that supports Android's Parcelable interface.

**Note**: This is an early version that requires the extension support currently in AutoValue 1.2-SNAPSHOT.

## Usage

Simply include AutoParcel in your project and make any of your `@AutoValue` annotated classed implement `Parcelable`.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Foo implements Parcelable {

  public abstract String bar();

}
```

Now build your project and enjoy your Parcelable Foo.

## Download

Add a Gradle dependency:

```groovy
compile 'com.ryanharter.auto-parcel:auto-parcel:0.2-SNAPSHOT'
```
